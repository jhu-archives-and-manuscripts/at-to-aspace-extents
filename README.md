# at-to-aspace-extents

XSLT used to generate a human-readable extents statement from Valerie's "Extent Workhorse" database for each collection in the following form:

  12 record center cartons, 2 document boxes, and 1 custom box (11" x 15" x 3")
  
Due to differences in the source XML, two different sets of XSLT exist: 1 for processed collections and another for accessions.
